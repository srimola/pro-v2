# PRO @ UCSD

####PRO (The Producers and Remixers Organization) is a student-run organization at the University of California, San Diego, that is dedicated to teaching the art of electronic music production. Our mission is to bring worthwhile music production knowledge to the San Diego electronic music scene, as well as build a community of musicians that can work and grow together.  

####We welcome people from all backgrounds and pursuits, including singers, songwriters, classical musicians, and everything in-between. Ableton Live is our software of choice, however the information we share is universal amongst all DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations). Come by our meetings and join the crew!
